Challenge #1 (I only completed this one):

Create a mysql database with store product information.

Ensure that mysql, inquier and table packages are required in the js file and installed in the command line.

Enter code to connect to mysql server/database.

Load the inventory table to view products available.

Using inquirer.prompt ask user to select product and quantity.

Register product request and compare to current stock available.

If stock is available, customer can continue with purchase.

If stock is not available, customer will be notified that the purchase cannot be completed.

Customer will finalize purchase and be given a total cost and total amount of items.
